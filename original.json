    "facts": "The cat is named Max. The cricket has a card that is red in color. The cricket is named Chickpea. The crocodile becomes an enemy of the cricket. The starfish does not roll the dice for the cricket.",
    "rules": "Rule1: If the starfish does not roll the dice for the cricket but the crocodile becomes an enemy of the cricket, then the cricket gives a magnifying glass to the halibut unavoidably. Rule2: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals gives a magnifier to the tilapia, you can be certain that it will also respect the lobster. Rule3: If the turtle knows the defense plan of the cricket, then the cricket is not going to give a magnifier to the tilapia. Rule4: Regarding the cricket, if it has a card with a primary color, then we can conclude that it gives a magnifying glass to the tilapia. Rule5: Be careful when something does not give a magnifier to the starfish but gives a magnifier to the halibut because in this case it certainly does not respect the lobster (this may or may not be problematic). Rule6: If the cricket has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the cat's name, then the cricket gives a magnifier to the tilapia. Rule7: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals holds the same number of points as the hummingbird, you can be certain that it will not give a magnifier to the halibut.",

    "example": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The cat is named Max. The cricket has a card that is red in color. The cricket is named Chickpea. The crocodile becomes an enemy of the cricket. The starfish does not roll the dice for the cricket. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the starfish does not roll the dice for the cricket but the crocodile becomes an enemy of the cricket, then the cricket gives a magnifying glass to the halibut unavoidably. Rule2: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals gives a magnifier to the tilapia, you can be certain that it will also respect the lobster. Rule3: If the turtle knows the defense plan of the cricket, then the cricket is not going to give a magnifier to the tilapia. Rule4: Regarding the cricket, if it has a card with a primary color, then we can conclude that it gives a magnifying glass to the tilapia. Rule5: Be careful when something does not give a magnifier to the starfish but gives a magnifier to the halibut because in this case it certainly does not respect the lobster (this may or may not be problematic). Rule6: If the cricket has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the cat's name, then the cricket gives a magnifier to the tilapia. Rule7: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals holds the same number of points as the hummingbird, you can be certain that it will not give a magnifier to the halibut. Rule3 is preferred over Rule4. Rule3 is preferred over Rule6. Rule5 is preferred over Rule2. Rule7 is preferred over Rule1. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the cricket respect the lobster?",
    "proof": "We know the cricket has a card that is red in color, red is a primary color, and according to Rule4 \"if the cricket has a card with a primary color, then the cricket gives a magnifier to the tilapia\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule3 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the turtle knows the defensive plans of the cricket\", so we can conclude \"the cricket gives a magnifier to the tilapia\". We know the cricket gives a magnifier to the tilapia, and according to Rule2 \"if something gives a magnifier to the tilapia, then it respects the lobster\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule5 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the cricket does not give a magnifier to the starfish\", so we can conclude \"the cricket respects the lobster\". So the statement \"the cricket respects the lobster\" is proved and the answer is \"yes\".",
