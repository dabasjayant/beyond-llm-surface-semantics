Now you are a data generator. We want to generate new data from raw data (BoardGameQA) based on some rules. I will also show you one example.

A) Type Dataset:
 Original BoradGAmeQA dataset: {
    "facts": "The bison enjoys the company of the worm. The leopard is 21 months old, and does not invest in the company whose owner is the owl. The leopard does not surrender to the dinosaur. The leopard reveals its secret to the German shepherd that it (leopard) stole money from dinosaur.",
    "rules": "Rule1: If you see that something does not invest in the company owned by the owl and also does not surrender to the dinosaur, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also destroys the wall constructed by the finch. Rule2: The leopard will not destroy the wall constructed by the finch if it (the leopard) is less than or equal to three years old. Rule3: If the bison enjoys the companionship of the worm, then the worm is not going to disarm the finch. Rule4: Regarding the leopard, if it works in education, then we can conclude that it does not destroy the wall built by the finch. Rule5: For the finch, if the belief is that the leopard destroys the wall constructed by the finch and the worm does not disarm the finch, then you can add \"the finch leaves the houses occupied by the basenji\" to your conclusions. Rule6: If at least one animal reveals something that is supposed to be a secret to the german shepherd, then the finch does not leave the houses that are occupied by the basenji.",
    "preferences": "Rule2 is preferred over Rule1. Rule6 is preferred over Rule5.",
    "goal": "(finch, leave, basenji)",
    "theory": "Facts:\n\t(bison, enjoy, worm)\n\t(leopard, is, 21 months old)\n\t~(leopard, invest, owl)\n\t~(leopard, surrender, dinosaur)\n\t(leopard, revealed secret, Germen shepherd)\nRules:\n\tRule1: (X, invest, owl)^(X, surrender, dinosaur) => (X, destroy, finch)\n\tRule2: (leopard, is, less than or equal to three years old) => (leopard, destroy, finch)\n\tRule3: (bison, enjoy, worm) => ~(worm, disarm, finch)\n\tRule4: (leopard, works, in education) => ~(leopard, destroy, finch)\n\tRule5: (leopard, destroy, finch)^(worm, disarm, finch) => (finch, leave, basenji)\n\tRule6: exists X (X, reveal, german shepherd) => ~(finch, leave, basenji)\nPreferences:\n\tRule2 > Rule1\n\tRule6 > Rule5",
    "label": "proved"
},

B) Type Dataset
Our desired datset that we want you to generate. Below format, you can see that new intermediate questionds and answers are added, and there are multiple rounds.

we are generating a B) kind of formatted dataset from A). Key idea is to have multiple valid rounds in B) type of dataset. So, as you can see from A), there is only one question and label (answer), whereas B) contains a new question, goal, and label for each intermediate round (except for the last round). Last round contains the same question, goal, and label as A) dataset.

Please follow below additional requests:
1.⁠ ⁠Last round's question, goal and label must match A)'s question, goal, and label.
2.⁠ ⁠From the second round, you have to, of course, consider not only the rules and preferences of the corresponding round but also the rules and preferences from all the previous rounds.
3.⁠ ⁠Goal should never be negated.
4.⁠ ⁠Also, in theory '~' means negation (don't treat it as markdown syntax).
5.⁠ ⁠ALL facts should only be included in the first round theory. You cannot have facts in all the rounds except for the first one!
6.⁠ ⁠Add rules in ascending order. (e.g. don't add rule 6 in round n and add rule 5 in round (n-1))




Q) So, for the below dataset, which is type of A), please generate B) type datset.

{
    "facts": "The cat is named Max. The cricket has a card that is red in color. The cricket is named Chickpea. The crocodile becomes an enemy of the cricket. The starfish does not roll the dice for the cricket.",
    "rules": "Rule1: If the starfish does not roll the dice for the cricket but the crocodile becomes an enemy of the cricket, then the cricket gives a magnifying glass to the halibut unavoidably. Rule2: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals gives a magnifier to the tilapia, you can be certain that it will also respect the lobster. Rule3: If the turtle knows the defense plan of the cricket, then the cricket is not going to give a magnifier to the tilapia. Rule4: Regarding the cricket, if it has a card with a primary color, then we can conclude that it gives a magnifying glass to the tilapia. Rule5: Be careful when something does not give a magnifier to the starfish but gives a magnifier to the halibut because in this case it certainly does not respect the lobster (this may or may not be problematic). Rule6: If the cricket has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the cat's name, then the cricket gives a magnifier to the tilapia. Rule7: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals holds the same number of points as the hummingbird, you can be certain that it will not give a magnifier to the halibut.",

    "example": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The cat is named Max. The cricket has a card that is red in color. The cricket is named Chickpea. The crocodile becomes an enemy of the cricket. The starfish does not roll the dice for the cricket. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the starfish does not roll the dice for the cricket but the crocodile becomes an enemy of the cricket, then the cricket gives a magnifying glass to the halibut unavoidably. Rule2: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals gives a magnifier to the tilapia, you can be certain that it will also respect the lobster.

    "proof": "We know the cricket has a card that is red in color, red is a primary color, and according to Rule4 \"if the cricket has a card with a primary color, then the cricket gives a magnifier to the tilapia\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule3 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the turtle knows the defensive plans of the cricket\", so we can conclude \"the cricket gives a magnifier to the tilapia\". We know the cricket gives a magnifier to the tilapia, and according to Rule2 \"if something gives a magnifier to the tilapia, then it respects the lobster\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule5 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the cricket does not give a magnifier to the starfish\", so we can conclude \"the cricket respects the lobster\".
